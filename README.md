# Teensy Analog Scope Logger

ðŸ“¡ A high-speed dual-channel analog logger using Teensy 4.1, capturing real-world signal bursts from systems like the Nano Burst Generator or other pulse-based drivers.  

## Overview

This sketch captures analog inputs (A0 and A1) at up to 10 Msps (subject to Teensyâ€™s limits), buffers them into RAM, and outputs them over serial in CSV format for further processing or visualization via a browser-based oscilloscope app.

## Features

- Dual-channel sampling (CH1, CH2)
- Circular buffer with trigger capture
- Trigger threshold logic
- CSV data output
- Compatible with SD card (future versions)
- Simple serial visualization overlay via HTML/JS
