## Hardware Attribution

This MOSFET driver board design is based on the open-source work of **Master Ivo**, who thoroughly developed and tested the v6.2 isolated gate driver concept. It has been adapted and included here with respect and gratitude.

Original component selections are preserved where possible. BOMs are split by distributor for convenience:

- [`Element14_BOM_for_3xBoards.csv`](./Element14_BOM_for_3xBoards.csv)
